## Quickstart: How to Run

### 1. Prerequisites
- Python 3.10+ installed
- Node.js 18+ and npm installed

### 2. Backend Setup & Startup
```powershell
# In repository root:
python -m venv .venv
.\.venv\Scripts\Activate.ps1
pip install -r requirements.txt

# Start FastAPI server on port 8000:
python backend/main.py
```
*The backend API will be live at `http://127.0.0.1:8000` (Swagger docs at `/docs`).*

### 3. Frontend Setup & Startup
```powershell
# In another terminal, navigate to the frontend folder:
cd frontend
npm install
npm run dev
```
*The web interface will be accessible at `http://localhost:3000`.*

### 4. Default Demo Credentials
- **Email**: `demo@sme360.ai`
- **Password**: `password123`
*(Alternatively, use the "Fill Demo Credentials" button on `/login` or register a new user account).*

## How to Run Tests

Execute the automated test suites using Python:

```powershell
# 1. Run Data Correctness Test (No NaNs, RF Model Probabilities, Database Migration):
python tests/test_data_correctness.py

# 2. Run API End-to-End Suite (Intake, Analysis, Soft Delete & Restore, Audit Logs, PDF/DOCX):
python tests/test_api.py

# 3. Run Authentication & User Isolation Suite (PBKDF2 Hashing, JWT Tokens, Route Protection):
python tests/test_auth.py

# 4. Verify Frontend Production Bundle Build:
cd frontend
npm run build
```
