## 1. Experiment 6 — Personalized Business Plan Structural & Content Matrix

We evaluated generated 5-section strategic business plans across 3 representative SME cases (`C00001`, `C00002`, `C00018`):

| Case ID | Category | District | Predicted Feasibility | Model Confidence | All 5 Sections Present? | Primary Recommended Strategy (TOPSIS) | Capital Runway | Roadmap Action Items | Plan Status |
| :--- | :--- | :--- | :--- | :---: | :---: | :--- | :---: | :---: | :--- |
| **C00001** | Grocery / Mini-Mart | Colombo | **Conditionally Feasible** | 71.0% | **Yes** | `Hybrid Digital & Local Delivery Model` | **3.5 mos** | 4 (0-3m) / 3 (3-12m) / 2 (1y+) | **Valid Complete Plan** |
| **C00002** | Grocery / Mini-Mart | Colombo | **Infeasible** | 98.0% | **Yes** | `Hybrid Digital & Local Delivery Model` | **0.3 mos** | 4 (0-3m) / 3 (3-12m) / 2 (1y+) | **Valid Complete Plan** |
| **C00018** | Grocery / Mini-Mart | Colombo | **Feasible** | 55.0% | **Yes** | `Hybrid Digital & Local Delivery Model` | **2.8 mos** | 4 (0-3m) / 3 (3-12m) / 2 (1y+) | **Valid Complete Plan** |

## 4. Key Findings & Pipeline Verification Conclusions
1. **End-to-End Functional Integration**: The complete Component 1 pipeline operates as a unified multi-stage decision support system. Inputs flow seamlessly from raw input validation (`02_preprocessing`) to ML classification (`03_04`), SHAP feature attribution (`05`), contextual TOPSIS ranking (`06_07`), What-If sensitivity (`08`), and synthesized strategic plans (`09`).
2. **Dynamic Context-Aware Personalization**: Each generated plan dynamically reflects case-specific SHAP drivers (positive enablers and risk hurdles), location district, operational staffing gaps, financial runway, and time-phased execution steps.
3. **Multi-Section Plan Completeness**: All evaluated profiles successfully produce complete 5-section business plans containing executive summary, operational setup, marketing strategy, financial runway analysis, and 3-phase action roadmaps.

## 5. Scientific Validity & Final Research Disclaimer
> [!IMPORTANT]
> **Decision Support Framework**: The personalized business and growth plans generated by Component 1 provide structured, evidence-based **decision support recommendations** for SME founders and analysts in Sri Lanka.
> They rely on statistical Machine Learning patterns, SHAP feature attributions, and TOPSIS MCDM optimization, and do **NOT** replace formal legal, regulatory (Component 2), or deep financial auditing (Component 3).
